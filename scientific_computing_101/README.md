Scientific Computing 101 with Python
====================================

This directory contains notebooks I used to deliver a workshop on
Scientific Computing 101 using Python. I introduced the Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib
libraries using Jupyter Notebooks. Each of the individual notebooks provides
an introduction to the relevant library, basic usage and advanced features
provided with the library. There are also relevant exercises and references for those
interested.

If you have any comments/corrections/suggestions regarding the contents of the
Jupyter Notebooks, please open an issue on the repository.
